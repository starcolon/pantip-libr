## What is Pantip?

[Pantip](http://www.pantip.com) is the biggest online Q&A community 
in Thailand founded in 1996. Pantip stores a very large 
user-generated questions and answers in numberous topics, 
e.g., lifestyle, health, tradings, technologies, sciences, 
sports, movies, and lots of others. 

## Why Pantip Librarian?

At a glance, Pantip is quite friendly to simple web crawlers 
as it uses `unique number` in the URL to identify a particular 
thread. By changing this number, you simply access another topic.
This is super simple.

Pantip Librarian is a quick prototype of Q&A site crawler 
which scrapes the content of a range of topics on Pantip site 
and analyses the popularity factors over the scraped data.
